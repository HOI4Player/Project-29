It already stopped working when I made the Ground. I really don't know why. I followed all instructions until Step #3 in "Specific Tasks to Complete the Project:"

Here are the erors if it helps:

Uncaught ReferenceError: BaseClass is not defined
Uncaught ReferenceError: Matter is not defined
Uncaught ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'Engine' before initialization
